## University

In University, I'm trying new things.

### Shooting Game (HTML + JavaScript)
<a class="zip_download_link" href="https://github.com/snoow-sub/portfolio/raw/master/univ/shooting.zip">Download this project as a .zip file</a>

It is a shooting game created in the class.
You will be able to play [here](https://snoow-sub.github.io/portfolio/univ/shoot/).

### Cancellation Information Acquisition Program (Python)<a class="zip_download_link" href="https://github.com/snoow-sub/portfolio/raw/master/univ/notify.zip">Download this project as a .zip file</a>

In my university, when a lecture is canceled, a notice will be posted on the campus site.
Get that information and notify LINE. And, information that has already been acquired is not notified.


### Build a website (AWS, Apache, Basic authentication, cgi, bash, PHP, MySQL)
The question of the Amazon Web Service adoption test was very interesting, so I'll describe it.
I set up a web server and created Basic authentication, four arithmetic operations, and a product inventory management system using SQL.
I was able to solve everything and implemented it.
The steps are summarized [Qiita article](https://qiita.com/snoow-sub/items/1e5a18a556425796775b).
<!-- The problem is listed [here](https://snoow-sub.github.io/portfolio/univ/aws_is_task/). -->


### Malware Classification(Python)
Comming Soon...
